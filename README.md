Underwater Robotics System – Powered by Raspberry Pi-Pico.

I’m excited to share a custom designed Underwater Robotics Control System, built for multi-motor co-ordination, sensor feedback integration, and controlled aquatic operation. This project showcases my passion for Embedded Systems, Power Electronics, and Robotics.

Key Feature of this project:
Raspberry Pi Pico as the central controller for real-time motor control and sensor interfacing.

Motor Control:
-2x High-torque BLDC motors with PWM level shifting.
-2x DC motors with PWM level shifting using VNH5019 motor driver ICs.
-4x High-torque servo motors with transistor-based 3.3V to 5V PWM level shifters.
-2x Linear actuators (via servo interface).

Power Management:
12V LiPo battery as main source.
Dual LM2596 Buck converters to derive 5V and 3.3V for various subsystems.

Sensor Suite:
BNO085 IMU which combine accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to track motion and orientation.

I have worked with Proteus 8.1 for Schematic Design. Later I have opted for EasyEDA platform for Schematic design And Circuit Design by integrating all the components.

This project helped strengthen my skills in:
-Embedded systems design
-Power electronics & voltage level shifting
-Real-time motion control
-Sensor data acquisition & analysis
-Circuit Simulation using Proteus

Platform used in this project:
Proteus, EasyEDA.
